Some fishing trip this turned out to be. Like, not even a nibble!
Open the mouth. Between the gums. Look out stomach, here it comes!
Like no one seems to be here, Scoob. And by the looks of this pad, I don't blame them!
I'm so scared. I wish I had a ham sandwich to calm my nerves!
Well, what do you know? A ham sandwich!
Man, what a pad for a scare in!
`Velma: Are you alright?`||Yeah, just as soon as I have 6 or 7 sandwiches.
Well at least you left me the olive.
Sleep nothing. I'm fixing me a super Shaggy sandwich.
What a nervous night to be walking home from the movies, Scooby Doo. And all because you had to stay and see "Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods" twice!
`Fred: What's an empty old suit of armor doing in the driver's seat of this pickup?`||Maybe he went out for the knight. Get it?
Nobody's getting my beautiful hair.
And the ham slice connected to the rye bread, lettuce connected to the boiled egg, mustard slapped on a salami slice, and the cheese I connected to the deviled ham.
`Velma: This mystery's got me baffled!`||Well, it's got me, like, hungry. When do we eat?
What a close shave! That was almost a catastrophe!
`Velma: C'mon Shaggy, help me open it!`||Uh uh, I don't like surprises. Especially spooky ones.
Somebody sure is a messy housekeeper.
Leave it to Daphne to pick the wrong door.
`Daphne: What a groovy spot for a beach party!`||Yeah man, I can already taste those chocolate covered hotdogs!
Wow! Like, this place is furnished in early Halloween!
`Velma: Things are beginning to add up!`||You mean like 2 and 2 are 5?
Velma, who do I know with long and skinny hands?
`Velma: Now what do we do?`||Like rest. I'm pooped.
One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and here I go!
`Velma: You suppose that's the miner moaning?`||Like, if I had a face like that, I'd moan too.
Lucky for you, I'm a dog lover! Yuck!
Hey! Look what I found, like, jars of chocolate syrup!||`Fred: Chocolate syrup nothing! That's samples of crude oil!`
`Daphne: There's so many groovy things to do!`||Yeah, like, swimming and eating, and, tennis and eating, and, driving and eating, and, eating and...huh?
I just remembered a dental appointment back in town!
Wow! How soggy can a guy get?
Yeah, you got him! King Kong in the flesh!
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's taking a bath in a haunted house.
`Velma: Say, what have you got on your feet? Roller skates? Why are you wearing those silly things?`||I'm not taking any chances. If we do see that ghost, he'll never catch me!
Cool! I'm an ice cube!
Like there's times... I'll do anything for a Scooby Snack!
Look at all this groovy stuff! Man, we could play Halloween!
Give me liberty or give me pizza pie!
The whole turkey!? Gone!?
Well that's the first wind I ever heard with a sense of humor!
